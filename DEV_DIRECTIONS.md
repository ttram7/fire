## Getting Started

Read through the README.md file to get started. This is addtional devleoper specific information.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Database

This code repository features a `db.json` file which has some starter code. As we migrate to MongoDB, this will change. To run the FIRE application locally, start the database with command `json-server db.json` or `npx json-server --watch db.json` if you do not have packages installed globally.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. 
The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
